This repository is for my single page application

This repository has 2 branches. Master and gh-pages.
I have used gh-pages branch for hosting my single page application which contains all the images, used in the single page application, under the folder "images".
Then it has one "style.css" file, which is my css file holding all the styling propertie.
And finally an index.html file, that is the main file for my single page application.

Should you have any concerns, please feel free to drop me a mail.
